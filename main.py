# I want to build static HTML pages that have information about household
# expenditure. I want to create an index page that links to each month.
#
# * one month worth of transactions = 1 static HTML page
# * one index page to link to all the months and provide an FY YTD overview
# * as each FY passes, generate the FY summary page for each
# * categorize income and expenses based on regex / predefined lists
